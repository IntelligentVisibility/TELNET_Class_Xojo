How to Use the TELNET_Class Class

I. Steps on how to intially setup the  TELNET_Class in your Xojo Project:

   -  Copy the TELNET_Class class to your project APP in the IDE

   -  Create a Sub class of the TELNET_Class (Ie. I created a Sub class named TELNET in my example App)

   - Implement the following Events under the SubClass:
       - TELNETDataAvailable:  This is the event that receives all TELNET information from the remote host
       - SendTELNETUserData:  This is the event that will send your data to the wire headed for the remote host
       - Errors:  Use this event to use the Error codes and messages that are available

II. How to Connect to a Host:  Use the TELNET_Connect Method to connect to a IPv4 host. 
       -  You must pass the IP Address(string) at a minimum. 
       -  You may also take advantage of then "Auto Login" feature by passing the username(string) and password(string)

FORMAT:  TELNET_Connect(<ipaddress>,<optional username>,<optional password>)

TELNET_Connect("10.10.10.1","mike","passw0rd")

- By passing the username and password OR username OR password will Auto-Enable
the "Auto Login" service feature.
-  The TELNET_Class will automatically detect the credential style -  Ie. Username/Password, password only, or none
